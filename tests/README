hello.exe is used as a sample input file for some tests. To recreate it
from source you need NASM (https://nasm.us/) and djlink
(http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/16bit/djlink/).

$ make hello.exe

The following files are compressed versions of hello.exe produced by
versions of EXEPACK.EXE and LINK.EXE:
	hello-masm4.00-exepack.exe
	hello-masm4.00-link.exe
	hello-masm5.00-exepack.exe
	hello-masm5.00-link.exe
	hello-masm5.10-exepack.exe
	hello-masm5.10-link.exe
To reproduce them you need DOSBox (https://www.dosbox.com/) and copies
of EXEPACK.EXE and LINK.EXE. You can get the files here:
masm4.00:
	https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/lang/microsoft/masm/4.00/
	MASM-016014-400.img
masm5.00:
	https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/lang/microsoft/masm/5.00/
	MASM500-DISK1.img
	MASM500-DISK2.img
masm5.10:
	https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/lang/microsoft/masm/5.10/
	MASM51-01511-DISK2.img
For example, to recreate the masm4.00 files:

$ mkdir masm4.00
$ mcopy -n -i MASM-016014-400.img -s ::/ masm4.00/
$ make hello-masm4.00-exepack.exe hello-masm4.00-link.exe
