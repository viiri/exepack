.SH NOTES
.P
This program only works with 16-bit DOS MZ executables.
It does not work with other formats
that happen to have a ".exe" filename extension,
such as the PE (Portable Executable) format
used for Windows executables,
If you try to compress a PE file,
you will only end up compressing the DOS stub
(the short program that prints
"This program cannot be run in DOS mode").
The program will print a warning like:
.RS
warning: EXE file size is 1168; ignoring
.I
NUM
.R trailing bytes
.RE
.P
There are several versions of the EXEPACK format,
with slight differences.
This program heuristically tries to determine
which format is in use.
In compress mode, it tries to produce files
that, in addition to being self-extracting,
use the same format and offsets as files
compressed by EXEPACK 4.05/4.06.
This is to retain compatibility with other external decompressors.
In decompress mode,
if the input resembles EXEPACK
(i.e., contains the string "Packed file is corrupt")
but its precise format is not recognized,
the program will display the EXEPACK header and executable stub,
and ask you to email them to the author so
that the format can be supported in the future.
