## v1.1.0

Compress mode now works. Before this release, because of a bug, compress
mode had only returned the input executable essentially unchanged (after
normalizing the EXE header and possibly truncating the file to the size
specified there).

Compressed executables now use a stack size of 128 bytes, up from 16
bytes. LINK.EXE /EXEPACK and EXEPACK.EXE also produce executables that
use a stack of 128 bytes.


## v1.0.0 2020-03-07

Initial release.
