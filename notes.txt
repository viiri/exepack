== Open questions

Is truncating the input according to e_cblp and c_cp the right thing to do?
Or should we rather just read to the file's natural EOF?
Perhaps we could compress/decompress entire PE executables, even if they are not runnable under DOS.
Currently we truncate with a warning.

Should we be checking the EXE checksum, when nonzero?
It's a bit awkward because you have to read to the end of the file.

Do we need to increase e_minalloc and e_maxalloc to account for
the extra memory to which the EXEPACK block copies itself?
